# Tsunami shakemap

The tsunami shakemaps are very simular to the earth quake shakemaps,
but instead that they contain a regular grid, they just contains
a couple of points with the maximum wave height.

This is regarding that tsunami data for maximum wave height only makes
sense for the costal zone, but not for the sea area or the backland.

You can take a look to an [example file](../testinputs/shakemap_tsunami.xml).
