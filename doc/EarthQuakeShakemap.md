# Earth quake shakemap

The earth quake shakemap is the very first supported one in deus.

This is a xml format that includes a csv (with whitespace for seperation)
of several fields in the form of the regular grid.

So something like this:

```
1 1 0.1
1 2 0.2
1 3 0.3
...
2 1 0.94
2 2 0.95
2 3 0.96
...
```

You can take a look in to the [example shakemap file]{../testinputs/shakemap.xml}. 
Also there is little different [file format for tsunami data]{../testinputs/shakemap_tsunami.xml}.
