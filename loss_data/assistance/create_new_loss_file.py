"""
This is a helper script to transform the
existing replacement cost files.
The old data are explicit about every taxonomy,
but it just follows a single schema.

For SARA:
The replacement cost from D0 to D1 is always 0.02
times the replacement for D0 to D4.
Same is true for D1, D2, D3, ... and other schemas.
The replacement costs for transitions from D1
to D2 can be computed out of this steps as well.

For the future we want to read the replacement costs
per building out of the exposure model.

However we can also include some fallback data in case
that the exposure model has no replacement cost data.
